    "* In general, charter schools performed better than district shools in terms of math, reading, and overall scores. The top five highest-performing schools were all charter schools, while the bottom five were district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a whole, smaller schools had higher average scores than the medium sized, while medium sized schools still out-performed large schools. However, medium schools had a higher passing percentage than small schools. Large schools seemed to be doing the worst in terms of scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average scores of math and reading were quite similar across different grades within the same schools. The level of performance was quite uniformed throughout the whole school.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The more schools spent (per student), the worse their performances were. The schools that had the best perfermances (i.e. highest average scores in math and reading, and highest passing percentages) were the ones with the least spending per student. To see it more in details, schools that spent the least ( less than $585) had 90.369459% overall passing rate, while schools spent the most, from $645 to $680, only got 53.526855% overall passing rate.\n",
